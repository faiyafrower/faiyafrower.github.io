<p>In the last class we reviewed for and while loops in C++. The main idea was that while loops are easiest to use when you cannot effectively determine how many times you want to run a loop. On the other hand, for loops are easiest to use when you know exactly or can calculate how many times you want to run a loop. The main examples we covered were calculating the factorial of a number (for loop) and determining the 10,001st prime number (while loop).</p>

<p>We then started to cover how to write and use functions in C++ and how to transform already written code into a function. Specifically, a function to check divisibility, a function to compute the factorial, and a function to determine if a number is or is not prime. The key concepts are that a function returns a value for use in the main program and that they exist outside of the main function.</p>

<p>Finally, we began working with the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> we all purchased. We went over how the Arduino is a microcontroller and you can think of it like a very basic computer without a keyboard, mouse, or monitor and worked on a simple traffic light simulation with LEDs.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">HOMEWORK</span>: Finish the function <span style="font-weight:italic">bool isPrimeFunction(int number)</span> if you didn't finish it in class. Remember you don't have to write this from scratch! You already have a program that can check if a number is prime. If you lost it check on the page for July 24 and you can get it there as well.</p>

<p>A reminder in case someone forgets, to compile a .cpp file, first you have to open a terminal/PowerShell window and use the 'cd' command to navigate to the folder containing your file; you may find the command 'ls' helpful to list everything in the current location. Then, for example a file called test.cpp, you compile it with: <span style="font-weight:bold">g++ test.cpp -o test</span>. Finally, you can run it with .\test.exe.</p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>functions.cpp</h3>

<p>This is the framework for the functions we finished in class 
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

bool isDivisible(int number, int divisor);
int factorial(int number);
bool isPrime(int number);

int main() {
  int i;

  //Should print 0, for false
  cout << isDivisible(5, 2) << endl;

  cout << "Enter a number" << endl;
  cin >> i;

  //Should print i!
  cout << factorial(i) << endl;

  //Prints prime/not prime
  if (isPrimeFunction(i) == true) {
    cout << i << " is prime!" << endl;
  } else {
    cout << i << " is not prime!" << endl;
  }

  return 0;
}

bool isDivisible(int number, int divisor) {
  if (number % divisor == 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

int factorial(int number) {
  int answer = 1;

  for (int i = number; i > 0; i--) {
    answer *= i;
  }

  return answer;
}

bool isPrimeFunction(int number) {
  //Fill in
}</code></pre>
