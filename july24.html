<p>In the last class we covered two types of loops in C++: for and while loops. We discussed how for loops are often used when you want to do something a certain number of times, whereas while loops are often done when you don't have a good idea of how many times something needs to be done. In fact, they are interchangeable, but one is often easier to use than the other.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">HOMEWORK</span>: As we discussed in class, 2 is the first prime number, 3 is the second prime number, 5 is the third prime number, and so on. What are the 11th, 101st, and 10,0001st prime number? I will post two hints: the first Wednesday night and the second Friday night to help people if they get stuck.</p>

<p>A reminder in case someone forgets, to compile a .cpp file, first you have to open a terminal/PowerShell window and use the 'cd' command to navigate to the folder containing your file; you may find the command 'ls' helpful to list everything in the current location. Then, for example a file called test.cpp, you compile it with: <span style="font-weight:bold">g++ test.cpp -o test</span>. Finally, you can run it with .\test.exe.</p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>addvguess.cpp</h3>

<p>This is the continuation of the number guessing program from the first week, with the addition of a while loop the game will keep on running until you win!
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int answer = 24;
  int guess = 0;

  //Everthing in the loop will run again as long as 
  //'guess' does not equal 'answer'
  while (guess != answer) {
    cout << "Guess a number between 1 and 100: ";
    cin >> guess;

    if (guess > answer) {
      cout << "Too high!" << endl;
    } else if (guess < answer) {
      cout << "Too low!" << endl;
    }
  }
  
  cout << "You win!" << endl;

  return 0;
}</code></pre>

<h3 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>factorial.cpp</h3>
<p>This is the program we worked on to calculate the factorial. I've included the 64-bit version so that you guys can play around with it; if you remember in class ours was 32-bit and could only calculate up to 16! correctly. What can the 64-bit version calculate up to?
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
//Needed to use 64-bit integers, integers up to 2^64
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int number;
  //A 64-bit integer, the commented line is a 32-bit integer. 
  //Only use one or the other, not both answer variables.
  uint64_t answer = 1;
  //int answer = 1;

  cout << "Enter a number and I'll tell you what number! is: " << endl;
  cin >> number;

  for (int i = number; i > 0; i--) {
    answer *= i;
  }

  cout << answer << endl;

  return 0;
}
</pre></code>
</p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>prime.cpp</h3>

<p>This is the completed code for the indicating which numbers are prime up to a limit that you enter. It uses a 'boolean,' a new type of data, like an integer or a double. A boolean only has two possible values: 'true' or 'false.' This should be a good starting point for the homework assignment.

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  bool isPrime;
  int limit;

  cout << "Find prime numbers up to: " << endl;
  cin >> limit;

  //Starting at 1, check all numbers up to the entered 
  //'limit' to see if they are prime
  for (int number = 1; number <= limit; number++) {
    //Assume the number is prime
    isPrime = true;

    if (number < 2) {
      isPrime = false;
    } else {
      for (int i = 2; i < number; i++) {
        if (number%i == 0) {
          //if number is divisible by the number 'i', 
          //it is not prime, so set isPrime to false

          isPrime = false;
          break;
        }
      }
    }

    //Print out the message, depending on the isPrime variable
    if (isPrime == true) {
      cout << number << " is prime." << endl;
    } else {
      cout << number << " is not prime." << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}</code></pre>
