<p>In the last class we covered two types of loops in C++: for and while loops. We discussed how for loops are often used when you want to do something a certain number of times, whereas while loops are often done when you don't have a good idea of how many times something needs to be done. In fact, they are interchangeable, but one is often easier to use than the other.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">HOMEWORK</span>: As we discussed in class, 2 is the first prime number, 3 is the second prime number, 5 is the third prime number, and so on. What are the 11th, 101st, and 10,0001st prime number? I will post two hints: the first Wednesday night and the second Friday night to help people if they get stuck.</p>

<p>A reminder in case someone forgets, to compile a .cpp file, first you have to open a terminal/PowerShell window and use the 'cd' command to navigate to the folder containing your file; you may find the command 'ls' helpful to list everything in the current location. Then, for example a file called test.cpp, you compile it with: <span style="font-weight:bold">g++ test.cpp -o test</span>. Finally, you can run it with .\test.exe.</p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>advguess.cpp</h3>

<p>This is the continuation of the number guessing program from the first week, with the addition of a while loop the game will keep on running until you win!
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int answer = 24;
  int guess = 0;

  //Everthing in the loop will run again as long as 
  //'guess' does not equal 'answer'
  while (guess != answer) {
    cout << "Guess a number between 1 and 100: ";
    cin >> guess;

    if (guess > answer) {
      cout << "Too high!" << endl;
    } else if (guess < answer) {
      cout << "Too low!" << endl;
    }
  }
  
  cout << "You win!" << endl;

  return 0;
}</code></pre>

<h3 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>factorial.cpp</h3>
<p>This is the program we worked on to calculate the factorial. I've included the 64-bit version so that you guys can play around with it; if you remember in class ours was 32-bit and could only calculate up to 16! correctly. What can the 64-bit version calculate up to?
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
//Needed to use 64-bit integers, integers up to 2^64
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int number;
  //A 64-bit integer, the commented line is a 32-bit integer. 
  //Only use one or the other, not both answer variables.
  uint64_t answer = 1;
  //int answer = 1;

  cout << "Enter a number and I'll tell you what number! is: " << endl;
  cin >> number;

  for (int i = number; i > 0; i--) {
    answer *= i;
  }

  cout << answer << endl;

  return 0;
}
</pre></code>
</p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>prime.cpp</h3>

<p>This is the completed code for the indicating which numbers are prime up to a limit that you enter. It uses a 'boolean,' a new type of data, like an integer or a double. A boolean only has two possible values: 'true' or 'false.' This should be a good starting point for the homework assignment.

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  bool isPrime;
  int limit;

  cout << "Find prime numbers up to: " << endl;
  cin >> limit;

  //Starting at 1, check all numbers up to the entered 
  //'limit' to see if they are prime
  for (int number = 1; number <= limit; number++) {
    //Assume the number is prime
    isPrime = true;

    if (number < 2) {
      isPrime = false;
    } else {
      for (int i = 2; i < number; i++) {
        if (number%i == 0) {
          //if number is divisible by the number 'i', 
          //it is not prime, so set isPrime to false

          isPrime = false;
          break;
        }
      }
    }

    //Print out the message, depending on the isPrime variable
    if (isPrime == true) {
      cout << number << " is prime." << endl;
    } else {
      cout << number << " is not prime." << endl;
    }
  }

  return 0;
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Homework Hint #1</h2>

<p>This is very similar to prime.cpp above, but there's a new variable: counter. The program will use counter to tell us how many primes have been found in addition to which numbers are prime. Counter is initially 0, but as the program loops searches through numbers starting from 1 up to the entered limit, it will add 1 to counter each time a prime number is found and tell you how many it found at the end. </p>

<p>Now, technically, you can run this over and over and try to guess where the 10,001st prime number is, but that would be pretty boring and take a long time. Can you figure out how to let the program keep running until it finds 10,001 prime numbers instead of hitting a limit that you enter?

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  bool isPrime;
  int limit;
  //New variable to keep track of how many primes have been found
  int counter = 0;

  cout << "Find prime numbers up to: " << endl;
  cin >> limit;

  for (int number = 1; number <= limit; number++) {
    isPrime = true;

    if (number < 2) {
      isPrime = false;
    } else {
      for (int i = 2; i < number; i++) {
        if (number%i == 0) {
          isPrime = false;
          break;
        }
      }
    }

    if (isPrime == true) {
      cout << number << " is prime!" << endl;
      //Remember the shorter way to write this is
      //counter += 1;
      counter = counter + 1;
    }
  }

  cout << "There are " << counter;
  cout << " primes less than or equal to " << limit << endl;

  return 0;
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Homework Hint #2</h2>

<p>This would be a solution to a similar problem to the homework. This program can tell you what the 11th, 101st, 100001st, or practically any 'nth' even number. Of course this problem is quite easy to do by hand also (the solution is always n*2), but I hope you can adapt this strategy to homework hint #1 to complete the homework. The idea is that instead of looping to an upper limit that you have to guess or go through a lot of trial and error (something for loops are better at), you keep looping until you find 'n' correct numbers (something while loops are better at). Hope that helps, we'll discuss the solution(s) on Sunday!

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int limit;
  int number = 0;
  int counter = 0;

  cout << "Find the nth even positive number (enter n): ";
  cin >> limit;

  //When we find an even number, counter goes up by 1
  //No matter what, number goes up by 1 each time (starting at 1)
  //Once counter = limit, the loop will stop
  //Whatever number is will be the answer we're looking for

  while (counter < limit) {
    number += 1;

    if ((number % 2) == 0) {
      counter += 1;
    } 
  }

  cout << "The " << limit << "th even number is: " << number << endl;

  return 0;
}</code></pre>
