                    <p>The Arduino is a microcontroller that is frequently used in industry and research as a prototyping tool that allows people to test their code before developing a standalone product. 
                    In this course, we covered basic C++ concepts, which translate very well into programming the Arduino. There are many provided examples and libraries written, which makes the Arduino a
                    good starting point for programming embedded systems.</p>

                    <p>We began with the Arduino's blink example program, which controls then on-board LED using pin 13. You can also find it through File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink</p>

<pre><code>// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
    // initialize digital pin 13 as an output.
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}
// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);   // turn the LED on
    delay(1000);              // wait for a second
    digitalWrite(13, LOW);    // turn the LED off
    delay(1000);              // wait for a second
}</code></pre>        
                     
            <p>Next, we split into two groups: one group worked with a <a href="https://github.com/michiganhackers/introArduino">4x4 LED grid</a> and the other worked with an 
            <a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/NewPing">HC SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor</a>. I have linked the libraries if you need them again. The 4x4 LED grid is custom built and not for sale anywhere,
            although they can be <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/2011/how-does-led-matrix-work">built individually</a> with more electrical circuit knowledge and supervision. The HC SR04 is easily found through Amazon or eBay, often selling for around $1 each.</p>
            
            <h3 id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In-Class Projects</h3>
                                
            <p>I'm sure all students realized the usefullness of libraries and the functions they provided with their project, even though their usefulness was difficult to appreciate in C++.
            The students that worked on an animated design on the LED grid additionally gained insight into hexadecimal, how LED matrix circuits are designed, and elementary bit operations.
            The students that worked on a backup collision sensor that you may find on many newer cars gained insight into sonar, hands-on circuit prototyping, and binary numbers. At the end, both groups
            explained things they learned to the other to share concepts.</p>

            <p>Finally, some students returned for an extra Arduino class. We worked towards creating additional functions for the LED grid and created a basic security system using the HC SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor.
            Furthermore, we talked about other Arduinos, such as the LightBlue Bean and the Arduino Mini, which provide certain niche advantages. For example, the Bean is wireless and battery-powered, making it
            and excellent portable solution, but the battery must be managed. On the other hand, the Arduino Mini is smaller, allowing for less-intrusive designs, but lacks a USB header, making it difficult to upload a program.</p>

            <p>Future projects students can work on with the Arduino often require some intial thought. For example, you might purchase a couple buttons and LEDs and create a turn signalling system for your bike, or if you purchase the 
            HC SR04 ultrasonic sensor or motion sensor and a speaker, you could create a security system with an alarm. Of course, your first attempts will have issues, maybe they fall apart easily or do not work as well as you
            would hope, but that's how new products get made! Think of an idea first, then look into buying the parts you need. For more guided instructions with the Arduino, I have heard good things about 
            <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/arduino-platform">this course</a> online. </p>

            <p>For learning more about C++, the best way I've found is to
            try to solve problems and learn through them. A site I really enjoy is <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">Project Euler</a>. It's a collection of math problems meant to be solved through programming (you may recognize the 7th problem) that
            can be solved in any programming language. If you want a change of pace, you may try programming in Python. Try to figure out what you've done so far in Python, if/else, for/while loops, finding prime numbers, etc. Then I would point
            you towards Project Euler after that. For other programming applications, such as Android/iOS apps or web-based applications, and aren't sure where to start feel free to ask me if you would like to get started in that department. They require 
            some setup instructions, just like we had to do for C++ in this class.</p>

            <p>Last of all, thank you for having interest in the class. I hope I could keep it interesting for the students and I never would have been able to do this without all of your support.</p>
